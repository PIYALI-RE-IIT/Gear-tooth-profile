- Clean the surface where the strain gauge will be attached thoroughly to remove dirt, grease, or contaminants.
- Gently place the strain gauge onto the sample surface. Ensure that the gauge is aligned properly with the intended strain direction. Apply gentle pressure to the gauge to ensure proper adhesion.
- Connect the strain gauge to the Wheatstone bridge circuit as shown in Fig.1. Ensure the gauge's lead wires are securely attached to the appropriate terminals. Connect the Wheatstone bridge circuit to the multimeter, which shows the output voltage V<sub>O</sub>.
- Turn on the power supply (V<sub>S</sub>) and set it to the appropriate voltage. Adjust the Wheatstone bridge's balance resistor(s) until the multimeter reads zero.
- Apply known loads incrementally to the material using adjustable weights or loads. Record the readings from the multimeter for each load increment.
- Record all data obtained during the calibration process. Plot a graph of applied load versus strain.

|**Applied load (N)**|**Voltage (V)**|
| :-: | :-: |
|0|0|
|100|0\.24|
|200|0\.47|
|300|0\.68|
|400|0\.91|
|500|1\.13|

The Plot of the output voltage versus load shows a linear relationship. This strain gauge can measure the strain while an unknown load is applied to the sample.
